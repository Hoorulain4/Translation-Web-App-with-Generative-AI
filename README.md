Here's a concise explanation of the Healthcare Translation Web App, manipulating the wording for easier understanding:
What it does:
•	Translates spoken words in real-time, helping with healthcare communication.
•	Works like this: 
1.	You speak into your microphone or upload an audio file.
2.	The app understands what you say using Whisper (think of it as a super listener).
3.	It then translates your words to another language (multilingual support!).
4.	You can see the translation on screen as text.
5.	To hear the translation spoken aloud, the app uses Google's Text-to-Speech magic.
How to use it:
1.	Open the app (link provided or run it locally following the instructions).
2.	Click the microphone and speak clearly while it's red.
3.	The app will translate your words and show you the text.
4.	It can also speak the translation out loud for you.
Bonus:
•	Detailed instructions and explanations are available in the "docs" folder (User Guide and Developer Documentation).
Note:If the audio recording doesn't show up after speaking, try clicking the "rerun app" button.
